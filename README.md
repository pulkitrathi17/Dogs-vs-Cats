# Dogs-vs-Cats
Classifies an image as containing either a dog or a cat (using Kaggle's <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data">public dataset</a>), but could easily be extended to other image classification problems.

To run these scripts/notebooks, you must have keras, numpy, scipy installed, and enabling GPU acceleration is highly recommended if that's an option.
